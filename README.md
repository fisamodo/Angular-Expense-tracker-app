Angular expense tracker.

Pretty basic app, point of making this was to learn more about angular basics as well as styling in general. App has a global sidebar to navigate on routes. 

Things i learned during the time i was making this:
-Forms, modals, components
-Designing a decent looking UI
-Angular and the way it works, learned to read and understand angular code, as well as how to structure a basic small app.

The point of this app wasn't to create a 'wow' effect, but rather to use it as a reference point to when i get stuck on a bigger project
